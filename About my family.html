<p>

  &nbsp&nbsp Our family is involed in Agricultural practices. We cultivate, we harvest, and also sells.<br>
Our family also practises the two type of Agriculture namely;<br>
<ul>
<li> <u>Subsistence Agriculture</u></li>
<li> <u>Commercial Agriculture</u></li>
</ul>
<br>
<u> Subsistence Agriculture:</u> This is the type of Agriculture whereby the farmer cultivates crops for himself and his family's consumption alone.<br>
<u> Commercial Agriculture:</u> This is the type of Agriculture whereby the farmer cultivates crops for sale.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbspWe do normally practice mixed cropping in our farm. I am proud that we are farmers because Agriculture also has a great value in my country Nigeria.<br>
I would likely advise many people out there to also join the practice of Agriculture. Agriculture is a business that can never bring one down unless he or she is not ready to work hard, it pays.
