Wow! This is my lovely sister we are talking about here.Her name is Gift. She's so lovely,kind and respectful. She is in Senior Secondary School one(1). She helps mom in the kitchen because they prepare meals together in the kitchen.<br>
&nbsp&nbspShe don't like hard work in the farm though,but she's just doing her best too. My mom gave her a private farmland in other to see what she can do with it.How she manages it and how she can stand alone on her own with Agriculture when the family is not there.<br>

I do always pray for her. May God almighty protect and bless her in Jesus name. Amen.</p>
